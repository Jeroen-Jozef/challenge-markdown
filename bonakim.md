## A funny story

I see all the people from here are good at riding a bicycle but unfortunately I'm not.
I learned it after I came to Belgium. 
I can ride a bicyle now but still always in fear and nervous.
One day few month go, I was going back home by bicycle from my class under the pressure as usual.
I was happy and relieved because I was almost home after turning the corner.
I couldn't see the height gap between two roads and turned right.
I fell off the bicycle and my chin got hurt and became purple.
I had to live with it for a month.
I was called "purple chin" by my family and friends.

### TL;DR
Have you ever had a purple chin?
